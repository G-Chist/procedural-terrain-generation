## Evaluation of the Algorithms
Here is the evaluation of our algorithms.

## Perlin Noise
The key features of the Perlin Noise include gradient vectors, smoothing, linear interpolation, and blending different octaves (higher octave has higher subdivision of the grid 
that we generate the noise on). Perlin Noise is highly adaptable and can generate detailed patterns, which menas that local changes are supported. However, the iteration in our 
code that supports the octaves/subdivisions runs exponentially as we recursively subdivide each original cell into four in every subsequent round.

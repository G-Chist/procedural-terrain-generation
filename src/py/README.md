# Procedural Terrain Generation Using Blender

Thank you for visiting our repo that demonstrates our project on computational geometry that features procedural terrain generation and 3D mesh triangulation! In this project, we implemented three well-known algorithms and brought active use of Blender. Afterwords, we used Pseudo-Delaunay Triangulation to perform a 3D mesh that allows us to see the skeletons. There is a mix of Python code and the built-in geometry nodes in Blender in our project and the three algorithms we used are: Perlin Noise, Diamond-Square Algorithm, and Worley (Voronoi) Noise. Besides the source code, we also included a few artworks (terrains) we made due to the random nature of the algorithms. Finally, there is an evaluation of the different algorithms and brief explanation of our modification on some of the noises attached. Hope you enjoy reviewing our project!

# Procedural Terrain Generation Using Blender

Thank you for visiting our repo that demonstrates our project! In this project, we used three different procedural terrain generation algorithms and brought active use of blender. Afterwords, we used Delaunay Triangulation to show perform a 3D mesh that allows us to see its skeleton. There is a mix of Python code and the built-in geometry nodes in Blender. The three algorithms we used are: Perlin Noise, Diamond-Square Algorithm, and Worley (Voronoi) Algorithm. Besides the source code, we also included a few artworks (terrains) we made due to the random nature of the algorithms. Finally, there is an evaluation of the different algorithms attached. Hope you enjoy reviewing our project!

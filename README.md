# Procedural Terrain Generation Using Blender

Thank you for visiting our repo that demonstrates our project! In this project, we used three different procedural terrain generation algorithms and generated terrains in blender. There is a mix of Python code and the built-in geometry nodes in Blender. The three algorithms we used are: Perlin Noise, Diamond-Square Algorithm, and Worley (Voronoi) Algorithm. Besides the source code, we also included a few artworks (terrains) we made with the algorithms due to the random nature of the algorithms. Finally, there is an evaluation of the different algorithms attached. Hope you enjoy reviewing our project!

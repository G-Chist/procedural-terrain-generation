## Week 1 results

- blender
  - following the donut tutorial, on Geometry Nodes as of right now
  - looked at scripting menu
---
- perlin.py
  - works in Blender
  - code commented out for readability
  - runtime seems reasonable
    - may need to look into rewriting using NumPy for improvements
  - vertex data saved to data/vertices.csv
    - we can go through the list of vertices and alter the Z coordinates (height) to prevent abrupt jumps given a set of adjacent vertices
---
- worley.py
  - did not work in Blender (runtime error)
---
- perlin_numpy.py
  - works in Blender
  - works like perlin.py
    - can generate fractal noise, which is more realistic
    - much faster
    - added parameter sea_roughness that allows the user to modify how smooth the surface generated by capping the terrain at sea_level is
    - added convolutions so that noise looks better in Blender and smoother in general
---
- related ideas
  - to generate paths, we can run a pathfinding algorithm such as A* on the generated terrain and adjust nodes adjacent to the discovered path to form a smooth road-like path
    - setting a reasonably high sea_level seems to generate natural paths (bodies of water)
  - we can write a function to smoothen the peaks or local maxima in order to generate a more traversable terrain
